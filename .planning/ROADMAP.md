# Roadmap: @Bangkok Dental Clinic

## Overview

Transform @Bangkok Dental Clinic's 40+ years of orthodontic excellence into a premium digital presence. Starting with design foundation and responsive framework, we build upward through navigation, hero section with Vanta.js animations, credential and service content blocks, interactive features (carousel, maps), and culminate in appointment booking conversion flow. Each phase delivers a complete, verifiable capability that brings the quiet Italian luxury aesthetic to life.
