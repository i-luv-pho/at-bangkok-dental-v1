# @Bangkok Dental Clinic

## What This Is

A premium marketing landing page for @Bangkok Dental Clinic, a 40+ year orthodontics practice in Bangkok led by Dr. Photjana Kittipibul. The site combines quiet Italian luxury aesthetics (Loro Piana/Brunello Cucinelli inspiration) with dynamic Vanta.js wave animations to create a memorable, high-end digital presence that converts visitors into patients.

## Core Value

Communicate Dr. Photjana's world-class credentials and 40+ years of expertise through understated elegance — the site should feel as refined and trustworthy as the care patients receive.
